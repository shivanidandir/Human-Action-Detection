# Human-Action-Detection

Developed a JAVA based application which helps in detection of human actions from video. The application uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification of actions and global features (canny edge detector , color, texture) was used for feature extraction from frames obtained via video processing. The testâ€™s accuracy is 91.95% with a precision of 94%.
